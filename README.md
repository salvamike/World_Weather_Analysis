# World Weather Analysis #

## Purpose of Analyis ##

The purpose of this project is to analyze weather around the world and create a trip planner that includes weather descriptions. Beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which are then used to idetify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. They can then choose four cities to create a travel itenerary. Using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route is created between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

In this data analytics project I was tasked by Jack, the head of analytics for the User Interface team at PlanMyTrip, asked me to help collect data to present regarding customers search page queries and their perferred travel criteria. Included in this github repository is the Python script, csv data files, and various images that show vacation locations based on a wide range of metrics.
